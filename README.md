# Matlab_EMG_classification
#classification of Emg signals is not easy task , here in this project I visualize the Emg signals of diifernt human body activities
#and extract features from the data which is coming from 8 channels or sensors from differnt muscles.

#after feature extraction i apply Ml algorithms like KNN for classification and finally we get average accuracy for 20 classes almost 70% which is not bad
